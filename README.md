This repository stores the files for my second year Object Oriented Software Development Module.

The final product had the following functionality:

  Basic
  •	Addition
  •	Subtraction
  •	Multiplication
  •	Division
  •	Equals
  
  Intermediate
  •	Memory Storage
  •	Screen Clear
  •	Error Handling
  
  Extras

Although the assignment is submitted I will continue to work on the final product.

Next goal is to implement Infix to Postfix conversion.
